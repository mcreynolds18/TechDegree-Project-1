          <li>I am pursuing a career in web design because I desire to express my creativity through creating user-friendly and aesthetically pleasing web pages. </li>
          <li>I've worked as an elementary school teacher for the last 4 years.</li>
          <li>The covid year was really taxing, but I persevered. I’m excited to explore a new career field - one where I can push myself, grow, and learn something totally new.</li>
          <li>I’m also a soapmaker, cardmaker, and baker. These have been my creative outlets up to this point and I look forward to adding web design to that list.</li>
