    <h1>Marissa Reynolds, Aspiring Software Engineer</h1>
    <h2>Work Experience</h2>
    <h3>Elementary School Teacher</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Grade 3: July 2019 - May 2021</li>
      <li>Grade K: July 2018 - May 2019</li>
      <li>Grade 1: July 2017 - May 2018</li>
      <p>I learned many soft and hard skills as a teacher that are easily tranferable to other fields and positions.</p>
    </ul>
    <h3>Service Desk Associate</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>May 2017 - July 2017</li>
      <p>This placement was so short because it was only temporary. The company was aware that I would only be available until the school year began.</p>
    </ul>
    <h3>Customer Service Auditor</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>September 2013 - December 2016</li>
      <p>In this postition, auditors would call the office of dentists and assess their staff's performance using our company's rubric. The doctor would then recieve a "grade" for how the staff member handled the call.</p>
    </ul>
    <h3>Fulfillment Associate</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>September 2011 - September 2013</li>
      <p>I worked this job part-time while I was earning my education degree. This was my first real job and I loved it. </p>
      <p>My coworkers and supervisors were kind and helpful. We truly enjoyed working together as a team. We even played cardgames together during our lunch breaks.</p>
    </ul>
